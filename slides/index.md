"After years of secretly monitoring the public, we were astounded so many people would willingly publicize where they live, their religious and political views and alphabetized list of all their friends, personal e-mail addresses, phone numbers, hundreds of photos of themselves and even status updates about what they were doing moment to moment. It is truly a dream come true for the CIA." - Christopher Sartinsky, Deputy CIA Director (The Onion)
